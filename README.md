# ImageToGcode

This application allows you to convert images to G-code, which is a language used to control CNC machines. You can upload an image, process it to generate G-code, and preview the result. The G-code can then be used with compatible CNC machines to produce physical objects based on the uploaded image. 

To use this app, simply upload an image by clicking the "Upload Image" button. Tesseract OCR will then process the image to extract text information. This information will be classified in different categories for generating G-code. You can also edit the extracted information and save it to generate new G-code.

The image, JSON file and the G-code can be downloaded in the Drawer menu.
